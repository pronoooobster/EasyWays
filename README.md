Logistics management system based on graphs

Technologies used: C++

- Dijkstra's algorithm is used to calculate the best route between two logistic hubs (if such route exists);
- Save / Load system is implemented to allow saving the graph in a file;
- Command-line interface created for the user to insert/remove nodes, overview the current logistics network and set variables when calculating the optimal route.
- Custom Node class created for the logistics network;
- To refer to nodes by a name, a hashmap (unordered_map) is used.
